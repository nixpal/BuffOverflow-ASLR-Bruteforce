# Buffer-Overflow-ASLR-Bruteforce
Bypassing ASLR by brute force memory address


1- Compile the time service c file and run it with your choice of port to listen to. Run it on Ubuntu 32 bit.
2- Run the python file against your ubuntu server and change the IP inside the exploit file to match your time server IP.

Have fun :)
